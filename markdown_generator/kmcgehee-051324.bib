   abstract = {Controlled assembly of plasmonic particles is vital for catalyst and sensor applications. Because light is considered a promising external stimulus, various methods for assembling plasmonic particles using photoswitching molecules are investigated. However, the light used to photoisomerize such molecules is often limited to the UV region. In this study, anionic ortho-fluoroazobenzene is synthesized to reversibly control the self-assembly of plasmonic nanoparticles under only green and blue visible light. This azobenzene alters the dispersibility of cubic gold nanorattles protected by a cationic surfactant via visible-light irradiation, causing a visible change in the solution color. It is possible that the cationic surfactant and anionic azobenzene interact to neutralize the surface charge of the gold nanorattles. Because the interaction is changed by the photoisomerization of azobenzene, the aggregation and redispersion of the gold nanorattles are repeatable. Through this method, the dispersibility of nonspherical plasmonic particles can be controlled using only visible-light irradiation.},

   abstract = {Herein, we propose a critical study balancing two metal-free dual activating systems, namely DBU/EtBr and TEA/TsCl, for the coupling of CO2 with 1,x-diols to afford (a)cyclic carbonates. In-situ ATR-IR monitoring correlated with DFT calculations led to mechanism propositions for the model formation of propylene carbonate from propylene glycol. Kinetics upon various experimental conditions were established for the first time, leading to an optimized synthetic protocol. The substrates scope was then investigated and selectivities toward the formation of cyclic or linear carbonates were correlated to the dual activating system and the diol structure. By choosing the suitable organic dual activating system, one is able to control the product selectivity to substituted ethylene- or trimethylene carbonate and/or acyclic compounds, providing a powerful tool to synthesize CO2-based precursors that are highly relevant for organic and polymer chemistry from ubiquitous building blocks.},

   abstract = {Cyclodextrin (CD)-capped gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can be applied in sensing, catalysis, and self-assembly processes due to their molecular recognition ability. As the plasmon resonance of AuNPs depends on their size, the size-controlled synthesis of CD-capped AuNPs is essential for the development of these applications. Herein, we successfully synthesized β-CD-capped AuNPs with diameters of 24-85 nm using a seed-mediated growth method. The AuNPs were prepared using a β-CD as both the reducing agent and the capping agent. Harsh reagents such as NaBH4and NaOH were not used. The size-controlled synthesis of β-CD-capped AuNPs was achieved by changing the amount of seed solution. We fabricated monolayers of β-CD-capped AuNPs by liquid-liquid interfacial self-assembly for application in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The SERS intensity is significantly improved by using larger β-CD-capped AuNPs. In addition, we found that β-CDs can detect pyrene with higher sensitivity than α-CDs on the basis of the difference in molecular recognition ability between α-CDs and β-CDs.},
