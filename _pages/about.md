I am a molecular scientist with a PhD in Engineering from the University of Tsukuba, where I specialized in the study of visible light responsive azobenzenes. Prior to my PhD I completed a MSc in physical chemistry and chemical physics at the University of Bordeaux. My doctoral research, conducted under the supervision of Dr. Yasuo Norikane, focused on synthesizing and analyzing crystalline _ortho_-halogenated azobenzenes. My expertise includes theoretical and experimental methods such as;  density functional theory calculations, single crystal x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy. My [published work](/_pages/publications) has contributed to fields such as nano/micro system control and energy materials.
